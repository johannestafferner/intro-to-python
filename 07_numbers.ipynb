In the example, we set all bits to $0$ except for the first ($i=0$) and second ($i=1$) because $1 + 2 = 3$. So the binary representation of $3$ becomes $00~00~00~11$. To be even more precise, the $3$ can be seen as a linear combination of the digits where the coefficients are one of two values: $3 = 0*128 + 0*64 + 0*32 + 0*16 + 0*8 + 0*4 + 1*2 + 1*1$. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one such combination for each number between $0$ and $255$.\n",

For example, we could write $3_{10} = 00000011_2$ or even shorter $3_{10} = 11_2$ if we omit leading $0$s. A subscript of $10$ implies a decimal number as we know it from grade school."

    "### Binary Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand these subtleties, we need to look at the **[binary representation of floats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format)**, i.e., review the basics of the IEEE 754 standard. On modern machines, floats are modelled in so-called \"double\" precision with $64$ bits that are grouped as in the picture below. The first bit determines the sign ($0$ for plus, $1$ for minus), the next $11$ bits represent an $exponent$ term, and the last $52$ bits resemble the actual significant digits, the so-called $fraction$ part. The three groups are put together like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$float = (-1)^{sign} * 1.fraction * 2^{exponent-1023}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that a $1.$ is implicitly added as the first of then $53$ digits and that both $fraction$ and $exponent$ come in base $2$ representation (i.e., they both are interpreted just as the integers above) but are inserted into the formula in their decimal notations. As $exponent$ is consequently non-negative (between $0_{10}$ and $2047_{10}$ to be exact), the $-1023$ \"centers\" the entire $2^{exponent-1023}$ term around $1$ and allows for the period within the $1.fraction$ part to be shifted into either direction to the same extent. Floating-point numbers received their name since the period \"floats\" along the significant digits. The period is formally called **[radix point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_point)**.  As an aside, an $exponent$ of all $0$s or all $1$s is used to model the special values NaN or infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the standard defines the exponent part to come as a power of $2$, we now see why the decimal value $0.125$ is a precise float. It simply can be represented as a power of $2$, i.e., $0.125 = (-1)^0 * 1.0 * 2^{1020-1023} = 2^{-3} = \\frac{1}{8}$. In other words, the floating-point representation of $0.125_{10}$ is $0_2$, $1111111100_2 = 1020_{10}$, and $0_2$ for the three groups, respectively (omitting leading $0$s)."

    "The important fact for Python practitioners and data scientists to understand is that mapping the infinite set of the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$ to a finite set of bits leads to the imprecisions shown above and floats are usually good approximations of real numbers only with their first $14$ to $15$ digits. If more precision is required, we need to revert to other data types such as a [Decimal](https://docs.python.org/3/library/decimal.html#decimal.Decimal) or a [Fraction](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html#fractions.Fraction) as shown in the next two sections.\n",

    "Some mathematical equations cannot be solved if the solution has to be in the set of the real numbers $\\mathbb{R}$, for example: $x^2 = -1 \\implies x = \\sqrt{-1}$ and the square root is not defined for negative numbers. To mitigate this, mathematicians introduced the concept of an [imaginary number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_number) $\\textbf{i}$ that is just defined as $\\textbf{i} = \\sqrt{-1}$ or often times as $\\textbf{i}^2 = -1$. So the solution to the equation becomes $x = \\textbf{i}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we generalize the example equation into $(mx-n)^2 = -1 \\implies x = \\frac{1}{m}(\\sqrt{-1} + n)$ where $m$ and $n$ are just some constants chosen from the reals $\\mathbb{R}$, then the solution to the equation comes in the form $x = a + b\\textbf{i}$, the sum of a real number and an imaginary number, with $a=\\frac{n}{m}$ and $b = \\frac{1}{m}$ also from the reals $\\mathbb{R}$.\n",

    "Such a \"compound\" number is also called a **[complex number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number)** and the set of all such numbers is commonly denoted by $\\mathbb{C}$. The reals $\\mathbb{R}$ are a strict subset of $\\mathbb{C}$ with $b=0$. $a$ is referred to as the **real part** and $b$ as the **imaginary part** of the complex number.\n",
