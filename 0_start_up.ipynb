They see how a project could be improved and provide new use cases (via the popularized concept of a \"[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)\"). The project grows both in lines of code and number of people using it.

    "- **Managers**: People that need to organize things and command others (like a \"boss\"). Their schedule is usually organized by the hour or even by 30 minute intervals.\n",
